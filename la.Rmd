This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd("D:\\SMT 6\\Analisis Deret Waktu\\rmarkdown")

#Input Data
water<-read.table("water.txt", header=T)
head(water)
attach(water)

#Mengubah data menjadi data time series
water.ts<-ts(WaterConsumption, start = c(2010,1),freq=12)

#Plot Data
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
autoplot(water.ts, color=c("#00868B"), size=1)+
  labs(x="Tahun", 
       title="Water Consumption in Saudi Arabia", 
       subtitle = "Period: Jan 2010 - Jul 2017")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
